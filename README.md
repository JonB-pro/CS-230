Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room is a game design company that currently has an Android app that is a game where you have to guess what
    an image is that is being slowly rendered over 30 seconds. Players are split into two teams, and play three rounds per 
    game. These players are The Gaming Room's clients. The new software the company requires is a web based version of the 
    game that can be played on multiple platforms and cross-platform.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    I believe the Evaluation section was the best section for me in the document.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    The document helped lay out the needs and possible constraints of the code, and allowed accurate reccomendations to be made.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    If I could choose a revision, I think it should be to the Reccomendations section. I believe I could have made better 
    and more detailed recomendations, especially in architectures and storage management.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    The user's needs were implemented by making sure the app was accesible by many various platforms, and that users were 
    secure when connecting to the app itself. It is important to consider user needs not only for customer retention but 
    because users may see things differently, leading to improvements and fixes that may be otherwise missed.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    I used to approach it by just creating the code linearly and as quickly as possible. In the future using different 
    methodologies like Agile and using documents like this to plan out more than just the code itself. This will allow 
    better code creation as well as easier integration to different platforms.
